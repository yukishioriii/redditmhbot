While for the standard augment, I feel like it is just nothing happens (no skill or slot expansion) most of the time. They would be roughly even if the standard augment gives something 1/3 of the time, so I wouldn’t say it takes more luck to roll off a specific skill on a piece that has one discardable skill with Skill+ than to roll standard on a piece that you don’t want to lose any skill on. Of course there is crafting cost difference, but I’m personally swimming in Embers and don’t think I can use them up before I get bored.\n\nRight, DB isn’t one of the weapons I play and hellfire cloak isn’t particularly good on DB, especially when wearing a set limits the build flexibility and there are too many better skills to use after TUs have turned a lot of set-exclusive skills into jewels. I usually run hellfire cloak on weapons that drops the bomb frequently like GL and air-dash CB, or couple it with resuscitate to boost raw on HH and SA.",

I understand people who want an easier to play Berserk set though. It is kind of scary to use at first, and it's not like I optimize for full damage on my builds.

(I typically have Hellfire Cloak for consistent uptime on Coalescence on the weapons I play so I kind of took Coalescence as granted and forgot it needs to be triggered.)\n\nRolling off Bloodlust isn’t more work if you use the Skill-focused one.

I run it on DBs it does take little longer to clear it, but it's really not that bad.

Difference is drastic so I feel obligated to point out the alternative if OP just want to use Berserk/Strafe for the benefits that Strafe brings. (Not sure which weapon OP uses but Strafe probably means either Bow or DB. DB is known to be one of the harder-to-overcome-Frenzy weapon so that’s that as well.)\n\nTo give some numbers on the regen effects:\n\nAt base, (i.e. when used alone), Kushala is 1 HP/s, Super Recovery Dango lv4/HH regen song is 1 HP/s, Fish is 2 HP/s, Bloodlust/Dereliction is -1 HP/s, and Berserk is -1 HP/s (up to -4 HP/s after being hit).\n\nDango shifter lv3 is 20 HP, Medic lv1 is 1.1x.\n\nSome example calculations:\n\nWithout Bloodlust and under Berserk, (Kushala + Immunizer) or (Kushala + Super Recovery lv4) is 2×0.75=1.5 HP/s, enough to out-heal Berserk’s basic tier HP drain (+0.5 HP/s) and still don’t lose much HP per second at Berserk tier 2 (-0.5 HP/s). So that’s why I call it low risk (or even comfy for weapons that take advantage of unlimited stamina). And dango slots are still open and no need to eat fish (slow animation and only lasts 90s).\n\nDuring Frenzy, (Kushala × Immunizer + Super Recovery dango + fish) × medic × regen penalty = (0+1+2)×1.1×0.25=0.825 HP/s. With -2 HP/s from Bloodlust and Berserk, it’s a net -1.175 HP/s.\n\nBloodlust is just 20% affinity after all.

If you know the monsters' moveset you will be fine. Roll away or have already repositioned yourself while shooting. Builds can be kinda hard to learn and understand if you haven't tried Bowguns before, since they will be skils new to you that only affect Bowguns. And learning the ammo types.

Anything useful or good you get is an improvement on the base piece, even if bigger improvements are statistically possible with enough rerolls.\n\nIf you keep rolling you'll keep getting chances to get something better, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth doing for you, as an individual player. Those are resources you could spend on other pieces. The time farming to keep rerolling could be put towards something else. You need to optimise your rolls like you optimise your playtime; are you trying to optimise competitively for faster hunt times, or are you trying to optimise less intensely with a focus on casual play settings? The answer affects what your priority should be.\n\nWhen I get something that's useful on a piece, I leave it and then start rolling on other armour pieces for the set I'm making. Sometimes that 1-slot (or whatever) becomes much nicer because of a roll on something else that can synergise with it. Sometimes it gets made irrelevant by another roll, and I reroll the first piece without worrying I'm losing anything of significance.\n\nRolling just a 1-slot on the Greaves is not maxing out on your budget. But you shouldn't necessarily aim for a maxed out budget with a really good skill and no drawback, not unless you actually need what that provides in order to do what you enjoy with your playtime.

(The actual number of function calls varies from 2 to 50+ each augment, not that it really matters.) **If you want different augments, you need to do more augments.**\n\nBack when Qurious Crafting was new, in TU1, there was a bug where highlighting a weapon augment would also call the (armor Qurious Crafting) pseudo-RNG function exactly once for some reason. As a result, people abused it by holding Down in order to alternate between all augment options and thus advance the RNG as far as you wanted for free (which some people incorrectly called 'randomizing your seed'). This was patched out in TU2, however.\n\nIn TU3 (when they added in Skills+ and Stability augments) they also decided to patch out another exploit: before that, every single Qurious Crafting augment operated off of the same single pseudo-RNG seed, which allowed you to advance the RNG at a discount by doing augments on rarity 8 armor (which is 1/4 the cost of rarity 10 armor augments) and stopping before a desired rarity 10 augment... but in TU3 they changed it so that every 'armor rarity x augment type' pair uses its own pseudo-RNG seed, thus preventing this exploit.\n\n**The Qurious Crafting's seed has never been able to be re-randomized.** In the base game of Rise, the pseudo-RNG seed used for melding charms was re-randomized each time you saved and quit after melding at least once (so for example you could meld a bunch, and if you didn't get anything nice within a thousand melds you could reset, queue up a single charm meld, do a quest to finish melding, then save and quit then reload, and your next thousand melds would be randomized), but this was patched out in (I think) TU1; now charm melding's pseudo-RNG seed is similarly never randomized and can only be advanced by actually melding charms.",

Then depending on if you're a raw/status weapon or you are an elemental weapon there's a few other damage skills you can tack on after that weapon's skill tax skill. \n\nGenerally for raw you want to use a status weapon so you can use Buildup Boost. The extra damage from Buildup Boost just tends to be free on taw builds where pure raw weapons cap out without any other damage skills they can get.\n\nThe choice between Dereliction, and MoH for raw is just it's easier to get MoH+BuB on more efficient armor peices than Dereliction. And Dereliction+BuB isn't any better unless you also get a lot of levels in resentment, and you have to deal with health drain.\n\nFor elemental you need to decide if the weapon benefits from pure elemental at all cost or having good raw damage as well as good elemental. \n\nFor the first one you do Dragon Conversion 3+ Furious 3+ Strife 2-3+ Dereliction 1 or 3. \n\nFor the second one you do Berserk 2+ Strife 3+ MoH 3+ Coalesce 3+Bloodlust 1-2 (you can roll 1 off) this build more easily gets AB7, and 100% affinity. In fact it gets 40-45% affinity from just Strife+Bloodlust. It also get infinite stamina, and quasi-immortality with Berserk. Has a funky playstyle to get used to. And benefits more from base elemental increase from weapon augmentations. \n\nIt's easier to get bigger elemental from Dragon conversion+dereliction builds that's less tied to weapon augmentations. But your raw will suffer for it. Which is sometimes totally ok.",

Your RB+B needs to be soaring wyvern blade. It gives you amp state charge both on the way up and the way down. This combo gives massive amp state charge. You want to end it with a RT morph attack because if you hit the monster with one after soaring wyvern blade it's delayed explosion does more damage.\n\nOne rotation of this combo fully charges an exhaust switch axe. Which is my suggestion for switch axe in the base game because they charge the fastest. You'll find plenty of builds online for the base game version of exhaust axe build they where quite popular.\n\nOnce you have amp state the generic best combo starting in sword, and if you aren't in sword morph to it, is B&gt;RT&gt;RT&gt;B&gt;loop (switch axe BnB). If you know the monster is about to start moving away to much then you ZSD in or if the amp state is flashing consider ZSDing at near the end of the duration. Alway end your ZSD with a soaring wyvern into a morph attack it massively increases the damage of any ZSD you get off. There's lots of other combos, and things to do, but I feel like these are the two most key ones.\n\nDon't forget to use switch charger liberally to keep your inside gauge up. A good gap closing option is morph attack to axe&gt;fwd+Y&gt;morph attack&gt;B(does triple slashes)&gt;ZSD or BnB combo loop (bread and butter).\n\nEdit: evade extender 1 should be a core skill too.

It has tons of non-Sunbreak specific info on how to play the weapon.\n\nSwitch Axe is on the lower end of mobility/defensiveness but it's a constant aggression weapon with lots of options between the two weapon forms. Axe is fast movement, slow attacks while sword is fast attacks, slow movement. You stay in the monster's face and flow back and forth between Axe/Sword to keep yourself safe while consistently pummeling it. You want to find the openings sheathed or with Axe, use Sword to punish the openings, and be back in Axe when you need to defend against the next attack and find the next opening.  \n\n\n* I don't find the Axe Heavy Slam to be worth using pretty much ever. It 's slow, doesn't bad damage, and the buff disappears when you enter Amp. Amp is easy enough to maintain (especially once you get Elemental Burst Counter) that I don't get meaningful contribution from the buff. I could see it being somewhat worthwhile if you're running Raw axes that are harder to fill the sword gauge on but I only play Elemental Swax. \n* Rapid Morph Lvl 3 is mandatory. The majority of Swax damage comes from RT Morph Slashs rather than Y/B attacks. You will use all 3 buttons but should be using more RT than Y or B.\n* Morph Slashes have notable movement components. Learning to use your Morphs as pseudo-dodge rolls is a vital part of Swax defense.- Starting as sword, B (Sword Double Slash) &gt; RT (Double Morph Slash into Axe) &gt; RT (Double Morph Slash into Sword) is the basic loop. Starting as Axe, it's RT (Morph Slash into Sword) &gt; B (Sword Double Slash) &gt; RT (Axe Double Morph Slash).  Same loop, just starting at a different starting point. The Axe Double Morph Slash is counterintuitively the most damaging part of the loop.\n* There are also combos that specifically build a ton of Amp/Phial. I use them instead of Axe Heavy Slam as \"I need to build meter\" combos. As Axe it's B (Wild Swing) &gt; RT (Double Morph Slash into Sword) &gt; RT (Triple Morph Slash into Axe). You can morph out of the first wild swing, you don't need to do 2+ swings like Heavy Slam. Both morphs in this combohave a bit of a fadeback in them too (no iframes). It's also incredibly important to note that axe B &gt; RT allows you to morph into Sword mode even if your phial is not filled past the white mark. When you force a Sword morph, land the next combo to build enough phial to stay in sword. \n* For sword the Phial/Amp combo is B (Double Slash) &gt; B (Heavenward Flurry) &gt; Y (Right Rising Slash) &gt; B (Double Slash). You can also begin this one from draw attack or axe drawn with a LS + RT Morph Slash into Sword followed by the string.\n* Run Soaring Wyvern Slash (I believe this is the air leap you're talking about). You can do a ZSD, do the explosion, and then LT + Y in the air to do the dive stab part of the Soaring Wyvern Slash. It completely cancels the slideback animation after doing a ZSD. You need 1 wirebug and to not have a completely empty phial after the ZSD explosion. If you can aim well, the sticky bomb from Wyvern Slash ignores part resistances just like the ZSD explosion.\n*  I always run Forward Overhead, Finishing Discharge, 2 Stage Morph Slash, and Soaring Wyvern Blade. I am not deep enough in Sunbreak endgame to run Dragon Conversion so I scroll swap between EBC and Switch Charger. I think EBC is better and plan to run only that but Switch Charger is helpful for learning the weapon and also good in its own right. You have no choice but to use Switch Charger only for base Rise. \n* Evade Extender/Window are useful for getting used to Swax. Extender especially lets you sheath less and use rolls to cover more ground which is nice QoL, I always run at least EE 1.",

It seems that this set is good for weapons that don't really too much on affinity or have parts of attacks not affected by affinity like SAED CB, SwAxe, HH, elem LBG. \n\nBut I think it isn't the best choice for DB as you'd want to max out affinity for DB and it's hard to add affinity on that set due to locking the armors you need to use.

THE defacto 5th skill to add to a set imo\n\nEvade skills (evade window/extender): hammer only has 1 counter in rise/sunbreak only, so thus very few defensive options. Lends well to hit and run, and these skills let you be quicker and more aggresive during a fight in both getting in and out. (Bladescale hone and adrenaline mix great with these in sunbreak btw)\n\nFor rise/sunbreak specifically, Wirebug whisper and Bloodlust: hammer has solid silkbinds and thus having wirebugs more often is nice. It also fills the frenzy meter fast af with not too many hits needed, and thus works good with the bloodlust boost imo.\n\nFor world/Iceborne specifically, Airborne and Affinity Sliding: world hammer fucking LOVES the ledges and slopes in world, and can pump out enough aerial damage to make a set of Insect Glaives jealous. Add these 2 skills, and every zone with a slope or ledge become a land of death and destruction of mass proportions. (Also recovery up is good, with hammer being able to abuse tf out of health augment and hasten recovery, so extra healing comes in extra nice. Add rocksteady+temporal mantle, and you can face tank and out heal the full assault of an elder dragon like it's nothing)\n\nTldr: bonk stick simple and strong, and needs next to nothing skill-wise to be that strong in any game, which thus leaves room for a fuck ton of utility/situational skills for more build personalization.",

Monster Hunter isn't really the type of game that you shelve after beating the final boss, you generally make new weapons/builds specifically so that you can farm more, so the idea to stop at one build strikes me as odd.\n\nI understand that people want to start somewhere if they aren't sure if they like the weapon (hence why raw builds exist for many weapons), but if that's the case you could just pick one element at random, try it out and only farm the other ones if it feels good to you.\n\nAs for raw bow viability, several people already replied to you, and the reason why nobody even talks about it is that it has been established that it's massively worse than elemental bow at this point. Could you still complete the quests within 50 minutes with it? Probably. Would you want to struggle every quest when there's more powerful builds available that are rather easy to farm?

It's for bow but the concept is the same, just replace the bow decos with skills for DB. I like this set as you have infinite stamina and insane element (I can reach around 270 with MoH3). The health drain isn't that bad either as you have a lot of options to minimize it and it's quite safe as well as you won't get one shotted. You're locked in blue scroll to use berserk tho. \n\nSwitch skill wise, I'm using demon flight, demon mode, rouundslash combo, spiral slash, shrouded vault. You can replace demon flight with demon flurry rush for specific match-up. You can also use ironshine silk instead of shrouded vault if you don't feel you need to counter a lot and to have a better sharpness management.\n\nA dragon conversion set is also nice if you don't like the drain. I'd recommend augmenting for furious 3 for more element resist. Avoid using skill+ when augmenting to minimize the element resist penalty as well. What I don't like about that set tho is that it's hard to reach high affinity as DB is better off maximizing affinity and element skills rather than raw skills.\n\nA mix set of risen kushala helm, risen teostra armor, goldian or silverlos gloves, scorned magna pants and risen valstrax boots is also viable and quite comfortable to use.

Almost everyone ran 1 or 2 gathering palicos in the base game so I'm pretty sure that's still the way to go.\n\nIn any case as a GS user you probably want one of your palicos to have Summeown Endemic Life for extra wirebugs, and if you want more damage instead of more utility you can replace one palico with a palamute.",

I even took a screenshot on my phone so I could pull it up quickly.\n\nHere's why I said 2.5% for Daora Soul. On a lot of weapons I really don't think you only get 5% affinity most of the time. All you have to do is get 5 hits in to get 15% affinity. Yes there's a 3 second timer that gets reset every hit. But like on CSS CB, DB, IG, SnS, LS this isn't hard to do at all. It drops often for sure, but your BnB combos proc it to full effect well before the combos end. Even on Hammer if you have Impact Burst up it adds an extra hit to all of your hits so you can realistically have it up a decent amount of the time. That's why I'd say the damage Daora Soul does for most weapons is around 2-2.5% during the whole hunt. That's why I've been saying Anti-Species is a 3% damage increase on my other comments. Though it's very weapon dependent. \n\nThat being said I actually have Bloody Heart on a lot of the weapons that I mentioned can use Daora Soul. But that's just because the raw on weapon augmentations seemed better than the 2% damage increase from Daora Soul, and there's nothing else to run, but Anti-Species or Bloody Heart. I'm fairly sure Bloody Heart is even worse than Daora Soul though I have zero evidence other than that's what feels like. \n\nIf there was a skill that let you extend the time of blood blight by hitting a dps check kind of in a bloodlust style. Like you have 20 seconds in normal blood blight, and if you do X damage you get blood blight that lasts say 20/40/60 seconds for lv1-3 of said skill, and you can keep reseting it with the dps check. Then Bloody Heart would be the best deco in the game because you can get like 30 or 35 raw out of it if I remember right. Unfortunately that's not a thing, and the uptime feels very low. Except sometimes on CSS CB where it has really good uptime when it counts sporadically in my experience. Not enough to call it good in any way though.",

Unless you just want to drop all of it, and go for grinder S or drop it to 1 with grinder S.\n\nEdit: Also remember you lose your raw from MoH if you use dereliction. So you need to get resentment for it to be worth it. Otherwise you're just trading 15 raw for 15 raw and then when it ramps up 25 raw. You get 10 raw for messing up your sharpness management. And you could instead just get another level of MoH to get that 10 raw, and you could get another level of it for 10 more. So you'd have to get either dereliction 3, or dereliction with resentment for it to be better than just more MoH. You have so much defense these days that the -100 defense it whatever.

Activates on hitzones of 20 or higher.\n- **Status Trigger:** If you use a dodge to iframe though an attack, every hit for the next 5-12 seconds will be guaranteed to do status buildup instead of rolling for the 1/3 chance to proc status.\n- **Defiance:** If the monster enrages, you get to ignore almost every non-damaging mechanic in the game. (Ignore roars, wind pressure, ground tremors, etc.)\n- **Guts:** Dango moxie but worse.\n\n_Anomaly Investigations:_\n\nThis is the endgame now. Quest are randomly generated, but you can lock them id you like it and continually increase the quest's difficulty level. Quest level will be capped by your research level, so be sure to get that up as much as you can.\n\nCertain groups of monsters will give you afflicted materials. You get better materials from higher level quest for that monster. You will also get essences for completing quest.\n\n- Afflicted materials -&gt; Weapon upgrades/augments\n- Essences -&gt; Armor augments (RNG heavy)\n\n###TU2:\n\n_Monsters:_\n\n- Flaming Espinas\n- Violet Mizutsune\n- Risen Chameleos\n\n_New Skills:_\n\n- **Intrepid Heart:** Do enough hits and this skill will allow you to hyper armor one hit from the monster with heavily reduced damage taken.\n- **Embolden:** If the monster targets you, you get bonus defense evade window, and guard. Guard gained from this skill does stack with regular guard.\n- **Buildup Boost:** If an attack procs status buildup, it gains bonus damage as well. (Very strong when combined with status trigger)\n\n_Flaming Espinas Weapons:_\n\nFlaming Espinas' weapons have a hidden poison effect not shown on the menu. It acts just like any other poison weapon except it can proc while also doing fire damage. This allows this set of weapons to be the only ones in the game that get use both element and buildup boost to increase damage.\n\n###TU3:\n\n_Monsters:_\n\n- Chaotic Gore Magala\n- Risen Kushala\n- Risen Teostra\n\n_New Skills:_\n\n- **Strife:** Bonus affinity and element when you have red health (the second tier of the effect activates when you have 60+% red health)\n- **Berserk:** On blue scroll, you're entire healthbar turns red and will start draining. During this time, you cannot take damage from monster attacks, the only damage you can take is from the health drain. However, the health drain will become significantly stronger if you get hit so it is still recommended not to get hit. Regardless, this skill is a great way to avoid getting possibly one shotted.\n- **Wind Mantle:** Using any wirebug weapon action will turn you're wirebugs green and reduce their cooldown. Hitting the monster after activating the effect makes it stronger. Sheathing will cancel and reset the effect altogether.\n- **Powder Mantle:** Do a certain number of hits to activate this skill. After activation, it will cycle between orange glow and blue glow in 30 second intervals. (20 seconds in orange glow, 10 seconds in blue) If you get hit in orange glow, the effect is cancelled but does a little damage to the monster. If you don't get hit though, the glow will turn blue and you're next attack will trigger an explosion that deals damage. The damage for this skill does have a MV, and it scales with your raw attack.\n\n_Chaotic Gore Weapons:_\n\nC. Gore's weapons have two amounts of affinity: one negative, one positive. The positive affinity acts like normal, but the negative affinity is a permanent chance the weapon has to do a negative crit. Even if you have 100+% affinity, C. Gore weapons can still get negative crits because of this. The only way to prevent this is by overcoming frenzy, which will convert the negative affinity to positive and add it to the other number shown. Clearing frenzy also gives you affinity and doing so through bloodlust gives you even more affinity. As such, despite the nature of these weapons, it is very easy to overload on affinity while using them.\n\n###TU4:\n\n_Monsters:_\n\n- Velkhana\n- Risen Crimson Glow Valstrax\n\n_New Skills:_\n\n- **Frostcraft:** Works the same as in Iceborne. Only recommended for use at max level, lvl1 and lvl2 aren't that worth it. Being sheathed builds up the meter, hitting stuff depletes it. The damage multiplier for each tier is: 1.00x, 1.05x, 1.2x, and 1.3x respectively.\n- **Dragon Conversion:** Red scroll turns all your element resistance into element attack for whatever element you are using. Blue scroll helps you build up extra element resistance. The conversion rate at lvl1 and 2 is 15% for melee weapons and 4% for ranged. At lvl3, its 25% for melee weapons and 8% for ranged. Only effects elemental attack and has no effect on status. (This skill is very stronf when combined with furious or dragonheart)\n\n_Velkhana weapons:_\n\nVelkhana's weapons have special synergy with its armor skill, Frostcraft. They will restore the gauge slightly more quickly that other weapons. However, the weapons themselves aren't anything to write home about and the faster Frostcraft recovery isn't fast enough to justify using them. As such, this effect largely isn't used for actual gameplay.",

Apart from that, chameleos blessing 3 extends the poison duration by 2x so you get more damage from the poison and higher up time with foray.\n\nAfaik, you can already roll for build up boost through armor augments early, though you may need some luck. And if you have someone you know that's high MR, they can host risen chameleos for you since you only need MR10 to join so you can start farming for Chameleos risegem which is needed for risen chameleos armor pieces and chameleos blessing jewels.\n\nApart from that, I think it's already good to start using the goldian or flaming Espinas LS since they have good slots and a bit of affinity, and in addition, flaming Espinas also does a bit more damage to fire weak monsters. Another beginner friendly tree is the Fine Kamura since it has good slots. But if you find the comfort of the really long purple sharpness on the gaismagorm LS, it's an alright pick as well.",

      "body": "Another interesting option at least for my S/A set is removing a level of AB for a single level of MT. You can run both RS, and MT. They trigger separately so every attack that crits will have 2 chances to not lose sharpness, and attacks that don't crit still get RS lv3. It only costs a single 2 slot for me to do that. MT is the opposite of RS in that the 1st level is the best vs RS the 3rd level is the best. It'd be more expensive, and worse on other builds than MT 3, but on mine because I get 2 levels of RS for free this is actually a pretty effective way to manage sharpness that also helps when you want to do zsd spam.\n\nAnd on a power phial axe you want to run anti-species not phial switch booster. zsd spam is the preferred way to play power phials. Unless you're running phial switch booster in which case zsd spam is less good than looping ground combos, but it's also worse than running anti-species and spamming zsd. On exhaust axes you want to run phial switch booster, and do ground combo loops. It does the best damage. However if you do run anti-species zsd will do the same amount of damage as the grounded loop, and both the loop, and zsd are barely less than with phial switch booster. So ideally on both you want to run anti-species, but it feels less bad on exhaust axes to me to run phial switch booster.\n\nAnyways I'd say just try a few different methods of sharpness management, and just see which one is working for you. Just remember that purple sharpness is only a 5% damage increase so if you give up 5% damage to maintain purple sharpness you didn't actually gain anything.\n\nEdit: I need to try MT more. I always have just gotten RS for free basically so I never really though to to much about sharpness management after that. It really does a very acceptable job most of the time.\n\nEdit 2: nvm with running MT1 I thought it was 40/60/80 not 20/40/80 for MT. Yeah you'd never want to run RS3+MT1.",

Wyvern Blade Luna has 330 base raw, gets up to 380 after Augments, Attack Boost 7 would get you to 428, and at that point, you need +90 raw before you'd use BuB3 before MoH?   \n\nI suppose there is also the option of just running Dere 1 with MoH just so you can also run resentment to add more Raw.

However on Switch Axe specifically I find myself going through all the white sharpness a little before there's a natural pause to sharpen sometimes. VS with every other weapon I never even have the though I might need some other sharpness management. The main reason I run razor sharp as well is that it's almost free on most of my builds. The Flaming Espinas gloves come with 2 levels of it so a single 2 slot deco gets me razor sharp 3. I don't have access to intrepid heart decos, but when I do I probably will drop the Flaming Espinas Gloves, and Boot (if I still have boots in any build I don't think I even do) on all my builds for something more efficient or for dereliction. Then I'll have to rework all my builds, and I may go master's touch instead.\n\nI do think a lot of people over estimate how much better master's touch is vs razor sharp especially in multiplayer. The first thing is with purple, and white sharpness you get more yellow hit numbers, but not all your yellow hit numbers will actually trigger WEX now so you have less hits with 100% crit chance than you might think. And you have to crit to even get a chance to trigger Masters Touch. If you only get a crit every other hit. Master's touch is worse than razor sharp. Now on my builds I do crit more than that, but it's still not that much better than razor sharp, and I'd lose other skills to fit it in right now.\n\nSpecifically with Reconqueress when I get the 5th augmentation slot unlock on that will give it a little bit of purple sharpness without any handicraft. I just got to required level to farm those afflicted parts for the 5th slot. For my Exhaust build I will probably switch to using PP/SS to keep the purple sharpness. And I'll drop some levels of defiance for it, and drop razor sharp. But I'm not going to gem in handcraft for it because that's just too much. I'll just wait for it to naturally get purple from the augmentation slot unlocks.\n\nI have no plans of doing that for any of my other builds though. Maybe on LS if I switch to Scorned Magna I'll add a handicraft 4, and go master's touch. For hammer, and IG I don't find myself going though the purple too fast, and even if I swap the hammer to Scorned Magna it will have similar sharpness to what it already has same for IG. Though on IG Scorned Magna is a side grade instead of an upgrade imo. Same on LS. For hammer though it's an upgrade for sure.",

A particularly important deco is at AR 71, the handicraft 4 to push your element SAs into purple more easily (I'm assuming you are using element since you mentioned risen val meta sets). The element jewel 4s start unlocking at AR 101 but until then you can just use the 3s where needed.\n\nThis set only requires a slot augment on a low rarity piece and it is quite effective and would be a considerable damage boost as you move towards 160 without working too hard to get the set.

You're basically just waiting for that one moment that is the right opportunity for the counter because it can't be a multihit and the monster needs to stay in place after the counter for the TCS to connect and that was just super boring to me. I wanted to actually be engaged with the monster instead of running around with the weapon sheathed while waiting for an opportunity.\n\nRageslash makes me feel like an absolute unit and the damage is great. Plus, you can aim the Rageslash in any direction which in itself makes it 100% more fun to use than TCS. The occasional multi-hits are the reason I put in Divine Blessing and defensive dangos, everything else in my setup is full offense. You haven't lived until you tanked an ultimate attack by an Anomaly only to smack it right back in the face with a buffed Rageslash. Seriousy, so fun.\n\nHaven't tried Surge Slash yet because I lack elemental greatswords but I definitely want to give it a try some time.\n\nI'll make a post later on with my build and a short video as a showcase.

My healing comes from Hinoa and Fiorayne, both throw healing powders a lot and I generally run a pretty defensive skill set. Divine Blessing, full defensive dangos (Defender Hi, Medic and \"normal\" Defender) which is usually enough. However, I play GS with Adamant/Rage which both give hyperarmor and further reduce damage taken, which makes me practically unkillable as long as I am attacking with either of those skills, which definitely contributes to me not needing to heal myself at all - if I actually do take a big chunk of damage, Hinoa throws a powder which is basically a full heal with the Medic Dango.\n\nI guess this all adds up to me being able to run fully aggressive dogs, but it is a lot of fun. I feel like a barbarian made out of titanium with this setup, and I usually complete hunts in 10min.\n\nYou can actually go with Para on dogs no problem, the silkbinder just doesn't really apply it anymore. If you need more procs, try the dual chain instead of the fangs - the attack rate of this thing is absolutely busted. I had para proc 2-3 times per hunt and still had sizeable damage output.

Dropping BuB or MoH for crit eye is a damage loss though. \n\nThat is on paper. In reality for hammer you might be right dropping AB for 100% affinity means those high MV attacks at the end of long animation locks will always crit instead of sometimes not criting. So it's rng if the current setup will actually preform better than 100% affinity.\n\nCrit actually has diminishing returns. Say you have 300 raw and 0% affinity and you're looking for a 5% damage increase. That should be 12.5 affinity with crit boost lv3. Ok so 300*0.875+300*1.4\n*0.125=315. That's a 5% increase, 315/300=1.05.\n\nBut now say you're at 87% affinity so your current damage is 300*0.13+300*1.4*0.87=404.4 and you add 12.5% affinity. You should get a 5% damage increase again right? Let's see I'm not so sure. 300*0.05+300*1.4*0.995=419.4. Wait a second 419.4/404.4=1.037. That's right getting 12.5 affinity at zero affinity is a 5% damage increase, but at 87% affinity it's only a 3.7% damage increase. \n\nThe more crit you stack the worse it gets, marginally ofcourse. If you chose anti-species you would have gotten a 5% damage increase at 87% affinity or 0%. All this is to say Daora Soul kind of mids, but I hate swapping anti-species. Attack boost has dimining returns too. Any damage boost sources that stack the same stat will actually. I definitely could swap out AB2 for 10% affinity, and run anti-species instead of Daora Soul. And it'd be better.\n\nWhen I get TU5 decos. Probably I'll drop AB2 for BuB 2 or MoH 1+BuB1, and then gem in the +4 crit eye deco. The only issue is it's waste full. The last two levels of crit eye give 15% affinity together so I'd overcap. Though if I swap to Scorned Maglamalo I'll lose 15% affinity, and then I can keep Daora Soul to get my last 10%, and gain the raw increase from Scorned Maglamalo along with a lv3 slot for the 2 lv1 slots. And I won't feel like I need to run anti-species. Even though it's way better like I was showing above.\n\nOne other thing to consider is you get affinity for free a lot in multiplayer. Cats can have the affinity boosting skills, and other people's cats effect you. Hunting Horn can give you affinity. The fish on the frost map can give you affinity. \n\nI'll definitely look into it more argumentation options though. The hammer build was very much just slapped together out of the parts bin.\n\nEdit: uh reddit formatting fucked up the math. I'm on mobile I'm not fixing it.",

      "body": "Garangolm can only achieve Fast Reload and not Fastest Reload which cuts into the safety/dps of the weapon.  To make matters worse, you cannot move and reload at the same time so you're helpless during that 1.35s animation (compared to 0.83s for Fastest Reload).  In addition to even get there you need 3 Recoil and 3 Reload jewels so that cuts into the slot budget of the build.  \n\nGranted you are right it has the highest raw, good clip size and good slots.  Ammo wise, you don't have status but you do get Wyvern.  All in all, not a terrible choice with the biggest con being the high recoil/reload skill investment needed but on paper probably deals the most dps (not sure though, the extra reload time is significant for dps too).  I'm not a fan of the poor QoL though.  \n\nTetranadon HBG has the highest raw damage for Spread3 that can still achieve Fastest Recoil/Fastest Reload along with walking reload.  Clip size of 6 is solid.  Downside of Tetranadon is poor slot (only lvl 2 socket), and you need all 6 recoil/reload decorations and no access to Wyvern Fire.  I think probably is the most used Spread gun and the \"meta\" choice since fastest/walking reload is valued more than 20 raw.  \n\nMagnamalo HBG is interesting since it also has a clip size of 7 but has low raw and very limited ammo options.  It does have a plus of being the meta Pierce HBG so can save on grinding there.  Has cheap recoil requirements of only needing 3 recoil jewels to get lowest moving recoil/fastest reload but still doesn't have the moving reload.  I personally wouldn't use this gun for Spread in the endgame since low raw and poor ammo selection but you can consider if you want a large clip size with low absorber/quickload requirements.  Pretty slot efficient in 3-1 so can't complain there.\n\nVelkhana I think is the most versatile spread gun with decent raw and access to moving reload/recoil and the same low investment of Magnamalo HBG.  You need 2 recoils and 1 reload which is equivalent to Magnamalo's needed investment.  In addition you gain access to Garangolm's Wyvern Shot and on top of that you have all levels of Stickies, and lvl 1 of all status ammo which none of the other spread guns have.  The 4 slot is not as good as Golm HBG but better than the other options and considering Golm you need to slot in 3 more lvl 1 skills, it kind of nullifies Golms slot advantage.  It's what I use for a Shield Spread set up.  Downside is the 5 shot clip size which is small compared to alternatives.  \n\nAll in all, for Spread, all the options have their pros and cons and there isn't really a clear best option.  I'd recommend for Shield though to stick with Magnamalo or Velkhana since you will need to fit in a lot of Guard skills and the extra investment into recoil/reload will impact the amount of dps skills you can later take.  Shield Builds already have a hard time hitting 100% Affinity as is.",

It also give you plus guard point( I think +2 point). Not really great for multiplayer with range player as monster run around making the thread break easily.\n\nSheathing retreat have good invincibility frame and it also push you backward. It is a great closing gap for long range if you do it with one wirebug roll.

In HR you can get away with a lot more, but its good practice for MR when you’re not going to be able to stay in air for nearly as long. Theres gonna be times where a quick vault into the descending slash is a safer way to close distance, and then theres times where helicopter is going to maximize your output. Diving wyvern is only really good when a monster is downed, or in multiplayer when its distracted with something else.",

I'm currently in the Lv 140 range for investigations and having no issues.\n\nElemental is the way to go because the best elemental weapons all have some slots for you to get to Element Attack 4 or 5 without changing your armour. Which is nice when you're like me and also farming for elemental bows, and elemental switch axes, and raw longsword and hammer and pierce lbg and pierce *and* spread hbgs. I don't want to spend too long tailoring each element just to shave off 1-2 minutes tops (something which unlucky AI rng can swing anyway).\n\nThe set I use is currently:\n\nBlood Baph / Khezu Shock Full+ / Dragondance Parasol+ / Aquatic Cataclysm+ / Flicker Blizzard Blade, all augmenting for Element Attack.\n\nRisen Kaiser Horns (Qurio Sneak Attack +1)\n\nRisen Kaiser Mail (Qurio Mail of Hellfire +1, Poison Resistance +1)\n\nGolden Lunebraces (Qurio Evade Extender +1)\n\nMalzeno Coil (Extra lvl 1 Slot)\n\nGolden Lunegreaves (Extra lvl 1 slot)\n\nAttack Boost 3 Bubbly Dance 1 Lv3-slot\n\nI got pretty lucky with the chest Qurio Augment and could drop Scorned Waist for Malzeno Waist to get partbreaker, blood rite, and attack +1 with enough 1 slots free to max out defiance so I can just ignore roars and keep the combo train going.\n\nSo with all the decorations that gives me:\n\nCritical Eye 7, Attack Boost 6, Defiance 5, [Element Attack] 4/5, Peak Performance 3, Critical Boost 3, WEx 3, Stun Res 3, Speed Sharpening 3, Protective Polish 2, Recovery Up 2, Blood Rite 2, Powder Mantle 2, Bubbly Dance 1, Evade Extender 1, Poison Resistance 1, Partbreaker 1, Mail of Hellfire 1, Sneak Attack 1, Burst 1.\n\nThere are definitely more optimal things you could build, but I didn't want Dereliction and instead wanted a template set I could use for anything without having to be especially focussed. It's absolutely worked for that; it's very intuitive and \"no thoughts, head empty\" while still being effective and successful. One point of evade extender makes a *massive* difference to how aggressive you can be without getting hit.\n\nIt kind of feels a bit like old longsword?

As the other person said, these can basically be used on any monsters. Other raw ammo types aren't as good dps wise but you might find it fun to use once in a while for a change of pace. \n\nFor element, you have 3 main ammo types (x4 elements). Pierce elem, rapid fire pierce elem, rapid fire normal elem.\n\nAssuming using the same build for all, pierce elem brings the highest dps among the 3 and easier to build since you don't need rapid fire up and they usually need less recoil or reload.\n\nRapid fire pierce is an option since they can output near the dps of pierce but they fire slower so they can conserve ammo which allows you to lessen the times you need to restock at camp, esp in higher anomaly hunts where monsters have insane HP. The downside is you need to use rapid fire up 3 and the guns require more reload and recoil skills. \n\nRapid fire normal elem is in the same boat as rapid fire pierce but for specific monster match ups that have good hitzones on only specific parts and their bodies are not long enough so pierce is quite bad. Examples would be small monsters like the great baggi, arzuros, crabs, rajang.",

Also, it's deviation is LR severe. You'll need to be super duper close for it not to mess your aim if you're not using any sniper deco. This is also the reason why Tetranodon was recommended before Velkhana arrived, and not garangolm. \n\nTetranodon is a bit better as in requires recoil and reload 3 and R mild deviation so at least it's easier to control. \n\nVelkhana only need recoils 2 and reload 1 so you free up 3 lvl 1 slots and no deviation. The 3 lvl 1 slots can be put to more comfort like defiance 3, stun resist 3, event toestra's blessing if fighting chameleos and other poison monsters.

I have my shield spread HBG with guard 5, guard up 3, Embolden 2, tune up 1 so that I can tank even the heaviest hits and still dish out good damage. \n\nEven in solo, it's better that you can control your status timings so you can basically chain cc the monster.

      "body": "I don't have the math to back it up but here are the reasons why I think chaotic gore got outclassed:\n\n1. Build up boost. The meta on raw sets seems to be around build up boost since it can be augmented now, so you need status weapons to trigger it. Scorned and lucent are status weapons so they can make use of BuB. This is also true for other weapon's raw sets.\n\n2. Weapon augment. Due to the buffs added in weapon augments, raw/status weapons got more raw just by adding slots. Elem weapons only get half of the raw since they also get element. Since you don't usually run element on GL, chaotic gore got less buff to raw. Iirc, it only gets 15 while raw/status weapons get 30.\n\n3. Better stats. Scorned and lucent narga has better slots than chaotic gore so there's more flexibility in building sets. Also they have natural purple sharpness so you don't need to slot in handicraft. So again, you can use the slots for other skills. Tho chaotic gore has really good affinity with bloodlust, it probably still looses out to scorned and lucent due to points 1 and 2.",

      "body": "I'll give my thoughts, but keep in mind they're all generalities and everything is case by case:\n\nDW is almost always going to be a higher DPS if you're able to land it. I always use it as my go-to, unless there's a reason not to.\n\nOne reason not to is that it has a very large animation commitment after you do it, where as Spike Finisher you can move (and attack) almost immediately. So, if you're \\*barely\\* going to get off a DW, but you may pay the price with receiving a huge attack (or getting OHKO) Spike may be better.\n\nAnother good example of where you can use Spike over DW is if you want to reposition yourself. Where DW will always put you directly down underneath you, Spike can actually propel you so far forward that the position may be advantageous. There's been times where if I DW I would have fallen off a cliff or be in a crap spot, but with a Spike I was able to overcome stuff on the ground, attacks, get into a better position for attacking, etc.\n\nAnother good thing about it is that the damage is \\*reasonably\\* close to DW, if you factor in the fact that you can move right away and get off additional attacks. For example, a 1500 DW or a Spike that does 500-500 and then allows you to start chaining another attack could give you nearly 500 more damage, making it be close to DW.\n\nSome hitzones are really small, too. Like Gore's head is very hard to hit with a DW, so, sometimes I make a Spike towards its legs and get off two nice crits, instead of inevitably missing and losing all damage.\n\nAnother easy and obvious example is if you're simply out of wirebug or stamina in that moment, which can happen from time to time. I've been out of wirebugs for DW or been out of stamina (to aerial dodge and reposition better over the head) but spike can disregard both of those things. \n\nSpike is incredibly helpful and valuable at times, but it's really a compliment \\*to\\* DW, not necessarily a replacement \\*of\\* DW.\n\nYeah the location you target with the spike has to be a little \"closer\" to you, because it moves forward and has an additional hit beyond where you land. Definitely need to factor that  in - but even that can be an advantage for reaching hard spots.\n\nNot to plug my own channel too hard, but I have some IG highlights video (aerial focused since I love aerial) and you can see how I utilize DW a lot AND Spike a lot, it isn't a binary choice between the two, but like the rest of MH weapons' tool kits, a choice of the two depending on the situation. Here's a couple examples\n\n[https://youtu.be/Yvr1vnjphBA](https://youtu.be/Yvr1vnjphBA)\n\n[https://youtu.be/OSqB4GkkZGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSqB4GkkZGw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/GbaDzH1hYTo](https://youtu.be/GbaDzH1hYTo)\n\n[https://youtu.be/6xcjemQsjVQ](https://youtu.be/6xcjemQsjVQ)",

There's definitely some opinionated conclusions to the math in there for defense, and I'm actually not really sure if I even agree with myself.

A lot of places online say affinity doesn't have diminishing returns, but it kind of does I think when comparing getting more affinity (when you have a lot) to another source of percentage damage increase.

      "body": "What I did was just calculate it with an imaginary 300 raw. Then I did 300\\*1.32=396, and 300\\*1.39= 417. So 417/396=1.05 so it's a 5% increase in damage like you said. Even though you multiplied you base raw by 32%, and 39% which has a 7% difference. The person I responded to initially has cleaner way to calculate this (A-B)/A so (1.39 - 1.32)/1.39=\\~5%Diminishing returns refers to the what happens when you just keep increasing the same source of damage amplification or keep increasing defense. This I think is best shown by increases in defense. So the formula for defense is 1-80/(80+defense) = percentage damage reduction. So at 500 you get 86.2%, and at 700 you get 89.7%, and at 900 you get 91.8%. As you can see going from 500 to 700 defense gives you a larger increase in damage reduction vs going from 700 to 900 defense. So you are getting diminishing returns for stacking the same stat.\n\nNow you may see the argument that this is not in fact diminishing returns as the effect health gain is linear. Say you have 100hp if you have 80 defense you now have 200hp. If you have 160 defense you have 300hp. Wow 80 defense always gives you 100hp so it's linear no diminishing returns right? But nah the first 80 defense doubled your health, 100% more health. The second 80 defense added gave you 50% more health. It was only half as effective at increasing your health so the returns are diminishing because you increased your relative health pool by less for the same stat investment. Why is this relevant?\n\nFor defense the goal is to go from 1 shot to 2 shot. Or 2 to 3 shot. What you'll find in MHR. Is going from 500 to 700 defense will get you out of a lot of 1 shots. Going from 700 to 900 almost never makes you from from a 2 shot to a 3 shot. What it can do is give you some room to not always have to fully heal to be out of 1 shot range. Investing in defense isn't as bad as people make it out to be, but also losing a lot of defense to mail of hellfire isn't that big of deal as you can see. These days more so as you naturally have that 900+ armor that you'd have to slot in defense boost lv7 to get in the past.\n\nOh btw I was just of wrong to mention diminishing returns with the comment before. I just thought I'd explain diminishing returns in MH a bit. You can think of damage increases as having diminishing returns too, but I think that's less constructive. Because the goal of damage is to decrease the number of hits to kill a monster. So you don't care that returns are diminishing because any increase is decreasing the number of hits to kill the monster. The only time you care about diminishing returns from damage is when comparing sources of damage increase to see which one is better.\n\nA good example is Daora Soul vs Anti-Species. Lets say you have 300 raw, and 80% affinity, and crit boost lv3. Daora Souls is 15% affinity I'm going to assume 100% uptime just to illustrate the point even though that's not real. So Daora Soul should be 6% damage increase which is better than Anti-Species. Or is it? So at base with 80% affinity you have 300\\*(1+(0.4\\*0.80) = 396. So 300\\*(1+(0.4\\*0.95))=414. Wait a second 414/396=1.045 that's less than a 6% increase. And here's Anti-Species 300\\*(1+(0.4\\*0.80))\\*1.05=415.8. 415.8/396=1.05 so it is a 5% increase, and is actually better than 100% Daora Soul uptime if you have high affinity. I don't know where the break point is btw where 100% uptime Daora Souls would be better. Regardless it doesn't have 100% uptime, but this was a fun little thought experiment.\n\nSorry if there's any typos or my math is wrong somewhere. Hope you found this interesting.",

At that point you should just augment something else.\n\nTherefore, simply saying \"Way more likely in skill+ rather than normal augment\" like you did is somewhat misleading, because in practice you wouldn't keep most of these Skills+ augments, and so the odds get cut low enough that Skills+ doesn't really feel worth pursuing anymore compared to Regular.",

Other than that, however, every skill within each cost bracket is equally likely (presumably simply selected by a modulo on the pseudo-RNG call, as evidenced by logged TU3 augments changing in TU4, but only if they were 6-/9-point skills because only those had new skills added to the list for augments), and of course higher-cost skills become less and less likely to actually be applied on augments due to their higher costs. I've rerun the above program with 10 times the number of augment simulations but actually split up 3-point and 6-point skills, and though I haven't edited the comment yet you can compare the final results for (say) 3-skill armor such as the Chaotic Helm here:\n\n* [Regular augments](https://i.imgur.com/2OgfepQ.png)\n\n* [Skills+ augments](https://i.imgur.com/LKsk9de.png)",

Build up boost only really on Scorned Maglamalo, and Gold Rath. If you're not using build up boost I suggest Royal Order LS, MoH 3, Wind Mantel 1, Powder Mantel 1. Though wind mantel 3 (totally feel great). My suggested armor set is Risen Kushal Head. FC chest gloves coil, Valstrax or Flaming Espinas boots. Valstrax is better, and becomes even better once you get Intrepid heart decos. Which I don't have, and I still run Valstrax. \n\nPersonally I run Gold Rath, BuB 2, MoH 2, Wind Mantel 1. And then I have a Royal Order one with Wind Mantel 2, MoH 2, Powder mantel. \n\nProtip for not whiffing sacred sheath. Just do it into the monster's attacks. The hyper armor will make you take extremely reduced damage as you swing right through it. Remember to bring stun resistance lv3 though or you can be stunned as soon as your hyper armor runs out from the damage you took. Oh also try to slot in a evade extender 4 gem. This will let you position well with Sacred Sheath. Just dodge through some attacks or back off to charge then move back in.\n\nIf you need to drop skills drop Attack Boost to lv4 from whatever you have it at. But I have AB7 and I could still gem in burst lv1.",

If you want to be lazy just stick with the Veil caster build, and you can just swap it for Scorned Magna IG for poison resistant monsters (I'm assuming your build has buildup boost, the only things you would really need to do is drop poison attack and chameleos blessing, blast attack isn't really worth it so use Helffire Cloak or something like that).",

Elemental attack does nothing to a weapon without elemental damage, and Sacred Seath style LS play doesn't benefit massively from elemental. It kind of does because it's good for Sakura slash, but honestly just focus on pure raw for Sacred Sheath playstyle. Gold Rath, and Royal Order are my favorite LS for it.\n\nEdit: V.Mizu is good too if you're still early in the post game.\n\nEdit 3. Besides the core skills from FC. The only skill tax left on LS is sharpness management. Personally I like long sharpness of white or purple and Razor Sharp. Master's Touch works too. You could also do protective polish+speed sharpening. But that takes more slota normally. Scorned Maglamalo LS is a popular choice for that style of sharpness management on a Sacred Sheath build. That's another good choice of LS if you can fit protective polish+speed sharpening. There's probably some meme grinder S build you could make work as well I guess.",

If you’re playing sunbreak it’s only used to help get a stun after a shoryugeki, it should not be used for sharpness maintenance (scroll swap to destroyer oil, which gives 20 sharpness, instead).\n\nDrill slash was not buffed along with the other sword moves in the patch going into sunbreak. Idk how the console patches work for rise, but if they have the same MVs as the start of sunbreak did you should never use drill slash. \n\nWhether you use raw (which is really usually poison but it’s the same deal) or element in sunbreak, your bread and butter is the lateral loop (a a xa on repeat) and the standard lateral combo (a a a xa) on a short window. There’s ways to adjust those combos based on positioning and sacrificing sharpness for some more damage (x x a a xa is a higher dps loop but lower damage/sharpness) but that’s going to be the usual deal. Hard basher additionally fell off for raw because raw wants to apply build-up boost from the sword (so even perfect rush is only good if you’re trying to finish the stun build up).",

I haven't looked into it\n\n&gt; Edit: also probably don't drop stun resistance lv3. If you tank stuff with hyper armor I think you can still be stunned on exit from the move from the chip damage if you don't have stun resistance lv3. Not 100% sure though.\n\nIt's an option but yeah probably better not to.  If you hyper armor attacks you can get stunned. When I was testing intrepid heart which should work the same as any other hyper armor against lucent nargacugas massive tail slam and it stuns without stun immunity",
